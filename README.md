Proved connectivity between physical dimensions and Y parameters of coupled-resonator decoupling network for wideband applications and isolated two antennas using a lumped network.

# Abstract
A new approach for isolating two adjacently placed coupled antenna is proposed in this paper. The technique uses coupled resonator decoupling network to nullify the effect of coupling between two antennas. Placing CRDN in between the antennas gives rise to different couplings in opposite direction of what previously bare antennas were possessing. Construction and design of CRDN is presented based on the admittance parameter which has been further converted into form of coupling matrix through rational function and analytical procedure involving simple mathematics. A clear relation is depicted in elements of the coupling matrix and physical dimension of resonators. The comparative results obtained through experiments and simulation for different designs proves electrical parameters are relatable with physical dimensions of CRDN. Proposed approach presents a way to apply it for asymmetrical antennas and MIMO systems.
